Thanks, Ron. After Michile and Ron's introduction, I think we have realised how important the rain forest is to us. Sadly, it is being/has been ravaged by the fire. Besides the Amazon rain forest fire, there are many more enrironment problems. For example, marine pollution, air pollution, global warming and extinctions of species. They are more serious challenges for human being.

Marine pollution is a serious issue, and it comes in many forms.
THE OCEANS ARE so vast and deep that until fairly recently, it was widely assumed that no matter how much trash and chemicals humans dumped into them, the effects would be negligible.

With the entry into the ocean of of chemicals,industrial and life waste, the ocean is becoming dirtier and dirtier. There are inputs of pollution into marineEighty percent of the pollution comes from land. Human bebing makes a lot of garbage. When the water flows from land to ocean, the garbage comes into ocean too. it can be found in the ocean, far away from land. 

Ocean are the lartest water bodies on the earch.
